            <h5 class="mt-0"> I am a recent PhD graduate from King's College London and GlaxoSmithKline.</h5>
            I am driven, adaptable and proactive PhD graduate with experience in the fields of consumer care, drug delivery and machine learning.
            <br>
            Through my involvement in commercial product development and my higher education I have developed a particular interest for colloid and interface chemistry, formulation science and data-driven problem-solving, along with a set of transferable leadership, team-working and organisational skills, which I am now seeking to expand on in a challenging, multi-disciplinary environment in the field of data science.
